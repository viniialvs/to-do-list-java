# Java To Do List
A simple and interactive **console-based To-Do List** built using **Java**.  

## Description
It allows you to add, list, and remove tasks through the console.
Completed tasks are removed from the list.

### Notes
Number inputs are validated â€” if you enter something invalid, the program will ask again.

Tasks are automatically numbered.
